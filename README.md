Simple automod addon for [Discord Integration](https://modrinth.com/plugin/dcintegration) mod with a simple config by deleting messages in discord whenever a blacklisted word is sent but its currently in development
There are some limitations like the addon not being able to block blacklisted words being sent to minecraft client (if anyone has any solutions let me know)
